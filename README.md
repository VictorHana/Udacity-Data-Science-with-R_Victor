### Project Title
Udacity-Data-Science-with-R

### Description
Project 1:
Investigate a Relational Database
Overview
In this project, you will use SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. You will write SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. As part of your project submission, you will run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of your queries.

We will begin by getting familiar with the database. We have included Practice Quizzes that include a series of questions that will assure you have mastered the main concepts taught throughout the SQL lessons. These practice quizzes will not be "graded" by a reviewer, but they will help you self-assess and make sure you are on the right track. The quizzes are there to assist you in understanding the database before developing the questions that you wish to include for the project.

The project submission is a presentation, which will be reviewed, and for which you will need to Meet Expectations to pass. For the presentation component, you will create four slides. Each slide will:

1)Have a question of interest.
2)Have a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question.
3)Have a supporting visualization created using the final data of your SQL query that answers your question of interest.
You will submit your project at the end of the project lessons. Your project will include:
1)A set of slides with a question, visualization, and small summary on each slide.
2)A text file with your queries needed to answer each of the four questions.

Project 2:
Explore Bikeshare Data
Bike Share Data
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

In this project, you will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

1)Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
2)End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
3)Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
4)Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
5)End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
6)User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
1)Gender
2)Birth Year

The original files are much larger and messier, and you don't need to download them, but they can be accessed here if you'd like to see them (Chicago, New York City, Washington). These files had more columns and they differed in format in many cases. Some data wrangling has been performed to condense these files to the above core six columns to make your analysis and the evaluation of your R skills more straightforward.
Statistics Computed
There are a number of different areas of interest available in this dataset. Here are some ideas we came up with for exploration, but feel free to explore any question you are interested in.

Project 3:
Project Overview
It's time to put what you've learned about version control and GitHub into practice! In this project, you'll be simulating a realistic workflow to refactor your previous BikeShare project using Git. Here's an overview of your tasks for this project.
3.1)Set Up Your Repository
First, you'll fork a repository to get your own copy of a template for this project, and then clone it to your local computer. Your first task will then be to add your bikeshare.py file, data file, and a .gitignore file to exclude your data file from version control tracking. This is a common practice to avoid sharing your data publicly, to avoid tracking unnecessarily huge files on GitHub, and because changes in data don't often affect our code.
3.2)Improve Documentation
Next, you'll practice creating branches using Git to make some changes to your project. In the real world, it's common to use different branches to manage the development of separate features or changes to a project. The first branch you'll work on is documentation. In this branch, you'll add project documentation in a README file, and make improvements to your docstrings for your bikeshare.py file. Then you'll push your commits back up to the remote repository.
3.3)Refactor Code
The next branch you'll be working on will be refactoring. Here, you can modify your bikeshare.py file to make improvements to the efficiency or readability of your code. You'll practice committing your code as you work on it, with at least three commits on this branch with meaningful messages. Notice that this branch touches the code in your bikeshare.py file, while the documentation branch touches the docstrings in your file. This means you can work on these branches simultaneously without any conflicts! This is a common practice in the real world.
3.4)Merge Branches
Finally, once you are finished with your work, you can merge both branches to the master branch, and push it back up to the remote repository.
